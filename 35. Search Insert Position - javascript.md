# Intuition
At first my intuition told me to approach to it somehow splitting the array in half and after checking if the value in half was lesser or greater continue splitting.

# Approach
I didn't follow my first intuition because I would have had to give it a bit more time and I was in a hurry, so I went for a second idea.  If the number was not present then I would need the find the closer lesser number to return the next index, so it seemed easy to just iterate one by one from the target down, and being carefull of determining if there was no lesser number.

# Code
```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
 */
var searchInsert = function(nums, target) {
    const length = nums.length;
    var index = nums.indexOf(target);
    if (index != -1) return index;
    if (nums[0] > target) return 0;
    let i = target;
    while (index == -1) {
        index = nums.indexOf(i);
        if (index != -1) return index + 1;
        i--
    }
};
```
